Trialled machine learning predictive models including Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regressions and SVM with Python; performed cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, and achieved accuracy ~80% for XGBoost;                                                                                                                                                                                                       built a robust data and machine learning pipeline to ensure the efforts can be scaled to future use
